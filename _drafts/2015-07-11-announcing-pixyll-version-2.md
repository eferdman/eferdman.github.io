In an effort to make Pixyll easier to customize and more aesthetically pleasing, we've release version `2.0`.

Pixyll now features:

* Line anchors in code blocks and new syntax highlighting
* A customizable variables file
* Modular, and lighter weight CSS
* No more `max-width` media queries

This Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
