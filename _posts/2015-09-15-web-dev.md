Here are my favorite programming resources and activities that are available for free online.

[Stanford's CS106A: Programming Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8)

**Prerequisite**: know how to recognize a computer that is turned on. 

This is for total beginners who are intrigued by the idea of programming. Brought to you buy Stanford's Center for Professional Development and Professor Mehran Sahami, CS106A teaches programming fundamentals through the Java programming language in an easily accessible and thoroughly enjoyable way. 

You'll need the short course reader, Eric Roberts' abridged *The Art and Science of Java*, and the course curriculum, all of which are only a Google search away.

_Projects_: You'll build games and programs such as Brickbreaker, Hangman, Yahtzee, and FacePamphlet.

_Commitment_: ~2-3 months

[Udacity!](https://www.udacity.com/) \| Browse through an extensive [catalog](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all) of courses to experience the free-ness, or follow a specific Nanodegree curriculum. Udacity regularly updates their website with new courses, so you'll never get bored. My favorites so far:

- __How to Use Git and GitHub__<br>
	_Start here! Learning to use Git and GitHub opens up a plethora of opportunities for those just embarking on their coding journey. If you're new to the command line, this is a great opportunity to get comfortable in your Terminal, while also learning version control. Just some of the benefits: track your project's progress, share your code with the world, build up your portfolio, discover others' code, contribute to open source projects, easily switch between the different stages (called branches) of a single project rather than downloading multiple starting points, freely host one static personal page and multiple project pages!_

- __Intro to HTML and CSS__<br>
	_Good starting point for understanding the DOM and interacting with Chrome's built in Dev Tools_

- __JavaScript Basics__<br>
	_Create an interactive resum√©_

- __Responsive Web Design Fundamentals__<br>
	_Design sites that scale across screen sizes_

- __Web Development__<br>
    _Co-founder and CEO of Reddit, Steve Huffman, guides you through the process of building a blog while introducing you to HTML forms, HTTP, Python, SQL, Google App Engine, and more_

- __Intro to AJAX__<br>
	_Integrate APIs such as Google Street View, NY Times and Wikipedia to display data from anywhere_

- __Object-Oriented JavaScript__<br>
	_Deeper dive into JavaScript: First 4 days of Hack Reactor Curriculum (check out their [full curriculum](http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/coding+schools+development+bootcamp+coding+bootcamp+learn+javascript) if you dare to DIY!)_

- __JavaScript Design Patterns__<br>
	_Organize spaghetti code using the M-V-\* pattern and Knockout.js_

...and the rest of the Front-End Nanodegree!

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) \| Your Virtual Code Tutor with discussion forums

This site gives you a great intro to just about anything -- HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, AngularJS, Ruby, Rails, command line, and many more. If you get stuck at any point during a tutorial, you'll likely find the answer to your question in the forums for that lesson. Codecademy also rolls out new courses frequently so be sure to check back.

Free Code Camp boasts 800 hours of challenges that range from basic to advanced, and offers opportunities to pair program and code for non-profits. Well worth checking out!

Type commands into your shell prompt and ask questions later! Codecademy and Udacity also have brief tutorials on the command line that complement Zed's nicely, but you should really start here!
