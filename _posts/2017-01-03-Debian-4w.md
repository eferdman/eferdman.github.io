Happy New Year Everyone! 

Aside from taking some time off for the holidays, I set up a Debian-Sid USB stick in order to test gnupg version 2.1.16-3, the version to be included in Debian [Stretch](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/gnupg). For now, I'm using the package rng-tools to speed up the key creation for the purpose of testing gpg commands. By running `sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom` before the gpg command, you can create the keys in about a second. 

Here are some of the sources that I've been using that inform the workflow and secure practices for gpg that we'll be including in the Clean Room: 

* [The Project Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/OpenPGP/CleanRoomLiveEnvironment)

* [Offline GnuPG Master Key and Subkeys on YubiKey NEO Smartcard](https://blog.josefsson.org/2014/06/23/offline-gnupg-master-key-and-subkeys-on-yubikey-neo-smartcard/) from Simon Joseffson's Blog. This is really helpful! I'm adapting a lot of the workflow for gpg2.1.16.

* [OpenPGP Best Practices](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices)

* [Debian Wiki: Creating Subkeys](https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys)

* [Debian Wiki: Keysigning](https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning)

* [Smartcard Guide](https://github.com/flamsmark/documentation/blob/master/gpg/smartcard-keygen.md)

Some feature suggestions that were made by Neal Walfield that could be included in the workflow: 

1. Use a smartcard for the primary key and a smartcard for the subkeys

2. Support subkey rotation-- the creation of new subkeys 

3. Upon finishing a session, write a script to the USB that sends mails with the signed keys and imports the user's public keys.
