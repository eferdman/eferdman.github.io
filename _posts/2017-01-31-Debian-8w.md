During the last few weeks, I learned about internationalization in bash and did a lot of refactoring/decomposing of the UI code, making the code a lot more DRY.

...Internationalization...

This intro to [Internationalization in Bash](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/internationalizing-those-bash-scripts) from the Linux Journal and this [Slackware doc](http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:misc:internationalization_and_localization_of_shell_scripts) put me on the road to internationalizing the UI code I had written thus far.

Instead of hardcoding strings into the whiptail commands, like this:

{% highlight bash %}
PRIMARY_UID=$(whiptail --inputbox "$PRIMARY_UID_TEXT_EN" 8 78 --title "$PRIMARY_UID_TITLE_EN" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)
{% endhighlight %}

I set up a Message Catalog in a Portable Object file for English: [en.po](https://github.com/eferdman/gpg-helper-scripts/blob/master/po/en.po). The .po file contains msgid-msgstr key-value pairs:

{% highlight po %}
msgid "EXPIRY_TEXT"
msgstr ""
"Please specify how long the key should be valid.\n"
"\t   0 = key does not expire\n"
"\t <n> = key expires in n days\n"
"\t<n>w = key expires in n weeks\n"
"\t<n>m = key expires in n months\n"
"\t<n>y = key expires in n years"

msgid "PRIMARY_UID_TITLE"
msgstr "Primary UID"
{% endhighlight %}

To make these .po files usable in a script, use the Linux utility __msgfmt__ to turn .po files into Message Object files:

{% highlight shell %}
mkdir -p $HOME/project/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/
msgfmt -o $HOME/project/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/ui-strings.mo po/en.po
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have a Message Object file, we can access the key value pairs in a script using the __gettext__ command. Pass the name of the msgid as a string to get back the localized natural language string:

{% highlight bash %}
whiptail_yesno() {	
	whiptail --yesno "$(gettext $1)" $DIMENS --title "$(gettext $2)"
	return $?

if whiptail_yesno "ENCR_SUBKEY_YESNO_TEXT" "ENCR_SUBKEY_YESNO_TITLE"; then
...
{% endhighlight %}

In order for this to work, though, it's important to export some environmental variables before running gettext. Mine look like:

{% highlight bash %}
export TEXTDOMAINDIR=$HOME/gpg-helper-scripts/locale
export TEXTDOMAIN=ui-strings
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
{% endhighlight %}

While setting up [whiptail functions](https://github.com/eferdman/gpg-helper-scripts/blob/master/whiptail_helper.sh) I learned that _one does not simply return values in bash_. With the help of another [Linux Journal article](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/return-values-bash-functions), I came up with:

{% highlight bash %}
whiptail_password() {
	__resultvar=$1	
	result=$(whiptail --passwordbox "$(gettext $2)" $DIMENS --title "$(gettext $3)" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)
	eval $__resultvar="'$result'"
}
{% endhighlight %}

to store user input as variables while keeping the code DRY. 

I also looked a little bit at [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml), gave my files better names and organized the directory structure. 

...GPG...

I was curious about the correct abbreviations, key lengths and usages for all of the gpg2.1.16 supported algorithms so I created a reference in [details/gpg-algos](https://github.com/eferdman/gpg-helper-scripts/blob/master/details/gpg-algos) that will come in handy for validating the user's input for different types of keys.

...Moving Forward...

Now that the code is much more readable, I can think more about the UI and the options that I want to include:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/main_menu.png"></div>

Lots more options could be added here.. Let me know your ideas.

Thanks for reading!
