Hello, my name is Liz and I study programming and web development in Berkeley, CA. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in English in 2014, I stumbled upon a YouTube course by Stanford called Programming Fundamentals  and became obsessed with writing code! I like coding in JavaScript, Python, Ruby and even Java (sometimes), but I am focusing mainly on JavaScript and the MEAN stack at this point.

I also love teaching and writing. And <span style="color: chocolate">chocolate pudding</span>.
