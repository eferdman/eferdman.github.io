Hello, my name is Liz and I study programming and web development in Berkeley, CA. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in English in 2014, I stumbled upon a YouTube course by Stanford called "Programming Fundamentals in Java" and became obsessed with writing code! Throughout my web development journey I've used sites such as Udacity, FreeCodeCamp, Workshoppers, Dash, and Codecademy. 

I like using Material Design Lite, Bootstrap, KnockoutJS, and Jekyll.

When I'm not writing code, I'm teaching, writing, hiking in the Bay Area, traveling, or eating<span style="color: chocolate"> chocolate pudding</span>.
